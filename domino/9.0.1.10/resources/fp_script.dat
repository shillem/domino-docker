# Lotus Domino Server for UNIX
# Incremental Installer Script Template


# The Lotus Domino Incremental Installer is used to update an existing
# installation to a new revision.  All installation settings are
# automatically set to be those of the last installation.


# There are two ways to use the Lotus Domino Incremental Installer:
#     1) Interactive Mode - the Domino installation on the local host
#                           is updated.
#     2) Script Mode -      you may specify one or more hosts on which
#                           the Domino installation is to be updated.
#
# Interactive Mode
#     To use, invoke the install program without any arguments,
#     such as "./install".  The Install Program will display the
#     installation settings, and prompt you to proceed with
#     the update.  For Interactive Mode, you do not need this template file.
#
# Script Mode
#     To use, copy this file, edit it, and invoke the install program
#     such as "./install -script /tmp/script.dat".  There are only
#     two changes you can make to this file ("target_hosts" and "installation_type"), below.


#
# "target_hosts"
#
#    If not set (by default it is commented-out),
#    the Domino Server will be updated only to the computer on which
#    the Incremental Installer is being run (the "local host").
#
#    If set, specifies one or more target hosts on which the Domino Server
#    will be updated.  The local host will be installed to only if it is
#    one of the hosts specified in the target_hosts list.
#
#    The double-quoted, comma-separated list may be specified on
#    a single line, or using multiple lines.
#    For example:
#    target_hosts = (
#      "host1",
#      "host2",
#      "host3"
#    )
#
#    To use this setting, be sure to remove the '#' comment character
#    on the "target_hosts=" line.
